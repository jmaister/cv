Hi,

Thanks for contacting for this position.

It looks good to me and I would like to know more details about it. My only concern is that I am only interested in positions that allow me to work remotely from Valencia, Spain. Would that be allowed?

We could talk on Monday, at 11:00, 15:00 or 16:00 (Spanish time).

Hi,

Thanks for sending this role.

At the moment I am looking for a 100% remote role from Spain.

Would that be possible for this position? If not, do you have any other position that would allow me to work from Spain?

Thanks in advance,
Jordi

Can you tell us in short about the exciting project you’ve worked on?

Predictive Analytics (SAP): Design Machine Learning processing with an drag and drop UI. After finishing an online course of Machine Learning I started working on that project. It combined working on the drag and drop UI to draw the data paths with how the server would run the ML processes. Learned a lot, including TypeScript and how to write Webpack plugins to load SAP UI5 (UI library).

Out of all the experiences in your career, what six month period was the most energizing/fun?

Event Framework (Mastercard): I designed the architecture and implemented an Spring library and a project generator. Users would design their event driven API using AsyncAPI spec, then the generator created a project plus the placeholder classes for the users to implement their functions. Regular demos and reviews with external teams to validate the results.

Cover letter Athenian

I am applying to the Senior Software Engineer position because it describes the experience and skills that I already have. Also, I like the field in which Athenian works and I'll be happy to work on it.

In my previous role in SAP, I was working on a analytics, insights and machine learning project. It involved developing the UI to show the results using user-defined graphs. On the server side, it involved translating the user-defined graphs to the data processing engine for calculating the results.

Thanks for checking my application. I am looking forward for a positive response.
